# Recipe for making Vada Pav
- Make potato stuffing
1.	Boil or steam potatoes in an Instant pot, pressure cooker or pan until they are completely cooked. Peel and then mash them with a fork in a bowl.
2.	Crush garlic and green chillies to a semi-fine paste in a mortar-pestle.
3.	Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and crackle them. Then add curry leaves and asafoetida. Stir and fry for about 5 seconds.
4.	Then add crushed garlic and green chilies paste, which have been crushed in a mortar-pestle. Add turmeric powder. Stir for some seconds until the raw aroma of garlic goes away. Do not brown garlic.
5.	Pour this tempering in the mashed potatoes.
6.	Add chopped coriander leaves and salt.
7.	Mix everything well and then make small to medium balls from the mashed potato mixture. Flatten these balls a bit. Cover and set aside.

- Making batter
1.	In another bowl, make a smooth and thick yet flowing batter from the besan, turmeric powder, asafoetida, a pinch of baking soda (optional), salt and water.
2.	The batter should not be very thick or thin. If the batter becomes thin, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of gram flour. If the batter becomes thin, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons water. Set aside.

- Frying
1.	In a kadai or pan, heat oil for deep frying.
2.	Dip the slightly flattened potato balls in the batter and coat it evenly with the batter.
3.	Gently drop these batter coated potato balls in medium hot oil.
4.	Depending on the size of the kadai or pan, you can add more or less of the vadas while frying.
5.	Deep fry these batata vadas till golden evenly.
6.	Drain them on kitchen paper towels. Make all batata vadas this way and keep aside.
7.	When they are still hot or warm, you need to serve them. Take all the chutneys and pav on your work surface.

- Assembling & serving
1.	Slice the pav without breaking it into two parts and keep aside. If you don't have sweet chutney, then just make the vada pav with green chutney.
2.	Spread both the green chutney and sweet chutney on the sliced pav. You can also spread green chutney on one side and sweet chutney on the other side.
3.	Sprinkle the dry garlic chutney. This is optional and if you don't have you can skip it.
4.	Place the hot batata vada sandwiched in the bread slices.
5.	Serve vada pav immediately or else the pav becomes soggy. You can also serve some fried green chillies and both the chutney along with it.

- **Notes**
1. You can always alter the amount of chutneys you spread in the pav according to your taste and liking.
